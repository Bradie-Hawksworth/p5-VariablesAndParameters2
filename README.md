# :wave: The Basics of P5 

## ðŸ¤“ Course overview and learning outcomes ðŸ’»

This assignment is going to build on from the p5-DiceFunctions assignment. In the p5 Dice Functions Assignment we created multiple representations of dice on the canvas. The image below shows an implementation of a six sided dice. The code provided in this assignment will display this when ran.

Over the next couple of Assignments we are going to utilise the functions we have just created in order to make a JavaScript representation of a dice. This will be in the form of a button on the screen that when pressed will generate a representation on screen of a dice roll.

This assignment will focus on learning about variables and function parameters. Links to the p5.js reference pages can be found below. The page links provide more information on the function and let keyword.

## Variables
[Mozilla Variable Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Variable) This link will take you to the Mozilla documentation regarding varaibles. A guide on how to declare variables in JavaScript can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#declarations).

There are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript;
* Var - 'Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.'
* Let - 'Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.'
* Const - 'Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.'

The given definitions mention the term *'Scope'*. A formal definition of scope can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope). Scope

The syntax for declaring variables and assigning them a value is as follows;
  var variableA = "variable A value";
  let variableB = "variable B value";
  Const variableC = 1234;

## Task - Experiment with variables.
* Declare a variable **before** the setup() block.

Experiment with console.log(), log the value of the variable within different blocks of code. What is the output in the output window? Are there any errors? Add some screenshots below showing what happened.

* Declare a variable **within** the setup() block.

Experiment with console.log(), log the value of the variable within different blocks of code. What is the output in the output window? Are there any errors? Add some screenshots below showing what happened.

* Declare a variable **within** one of your user defined functions. 

Experiment with console.log(), log the value of the variable within different blocks of code. What is the output in the output window? Are there any errors? Add some screenshots below showing what happened.

* Create a new branch and commit your modifications.

## Task - Experiment with each type of variable in different scopes.
* Using the three different ways of declaring variables. User var, let and const declare three variables at **before** the setup() function call. Try and reassign each of the variables within the draw function and the user designed function. Add descriptions of what the outcome was below.
